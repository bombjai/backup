What is Sass?

It's a CSS-preprocessor. Sass includes feature like variables, nesting, mixins, functions, and more. In the end it will help us create the css file.

Sass stands for Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets. 

Another version could be called. SCSS stands for Sassy Cascading Style Sheet.

The different between sass and scss is the syntax. Sass file doesn't require to put any curly braces or semi-colon. While scss is very similar to css.
